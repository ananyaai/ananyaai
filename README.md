🚀 Code adventurer, occasionally lost but 
always finding cool bugs... I mean, features!

💻 Constantly learning (and 😶‍🌫️forgetting) new things!

🤝 Open-source fan—because teamwork
makes the dream work (and I need help🥲).

🌟 Breaking code, fixing it, and
pretending it was intentional.😶

😄 Let’s build awesome stuff...
or at least something that compiles!🌟🌟🌟

 Tada👋👋 bye fir mileage 😄
